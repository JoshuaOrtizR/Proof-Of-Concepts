## Vulnerability Types

## RCE (Remote Code Execution)
- **Definition:** An attacker can execute arbitrary code on a remote system.
- **Functionality:** Exploiting vulnerabilities like buffer overflows, injection attacks, or unpatched software can allow an attacker to inject malicious code into a system's memory, leading to its execution.
- **Impact:** Can compromise the entire system, steal sensitive data, or launch further attacks.

## Buffer Overflow
- **Definition:** Occurs when a program writes more data to a buffer than it can hold, overwriting adjacent memory locations.
- **Functionality:** Attackers can manipulate input to a program to trigger a buffer overflow, potentially overwriting critical system functions or executing malicious code.
- **Impact:** Can lead to RCE, denial of service, or other security breaches.

## Zero-Day Vulnerability
- **Definition:** A newly discovered vulnerability that is unknown to the software vendor.
- **Functionality:** Attackers can exploit these vulnerabilities before a patch is available, gaining unauthorized access.
- **Impact:** Can be highly damaging as there is no immediate defense.

## SQL Injection Vulnerability
- **Definition:** Attackers inject malicious SQL code into input fields to manipulate database queries.
- **Functionality:** By crafting malicious input, attackers can gain unauthorized access to sensitive data, modify or delete data, or even take control of the database server.
- **Impact:** Can lead to data breaches, system compromise, or denial of service.

## Privilege Escalation
- **Definition:** An attacker gains unauthorized access to higher-level system privileges.
- **Functionality:** Exploiting vulnerabilities in software or operating systems can allow attackers to elevate their privileges, bypassing security controls.
- **Impact:** Can grant attackers full system control, enabling them to steal data, install malware, or launch further attacks.

## Spoofing Vulnerability
- **Definition:** Attackers disguise their identity or the origin of a message to deceive targets.
- **Functionality:** Attackers can spoof IP addresses, email addresses, or other identifying information to trick users or systems into trusting malicious actions.
- **Impact:** Can lead to phishing attacks, unauthorized access, or data breaches.

 ## Denial of Service (DoS)
- **Definition:** Overwhelming a system or network with traffic, making it unavailable to legitimate users.
- **Functionality:** Attackers can flood a system with requests, consume system resources, or exploit vulnerabilities to disrupt services.
- **Impact:** Can cause significant downtime and financial loss.

## Brute Force Attack
- **Definition:** Trying numerous password combinations to gain unauthorized access.
- **Functionality:** Attackers use automated tools to systematically guess passwords, often targeting weak or default passwords.
- **Impact:** Can lead to account compromise and unauthorized access.

 ## Dictionary Attack
- **Definition:** Using a list of common passwords to guess user credentials.
- **Functionality:** Attackers leverage dictionaries or wordlists to try common passwords, usernames, or phrases.
- **Impact:** Can compromise accounts with weak or easily guessed passwords.
